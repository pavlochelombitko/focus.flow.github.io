## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Just open it
Download `index.html` and open it in your browser. That's it.

### Option 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Fork this repository
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Set source to `main` branch
4. Your timer is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/study-timer`

### Option 3: Drop it anywhere
Since it's a single HTML file with zero dependencies, you can host it on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static hosting — just drag and drop.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The timer follows the Pomodoro technique:

1. **Focus** — Work for a set duration (default 25 min)
2. **Break** — Rest for a short period (default 5 min)
3. **Repeat** — Track your sessions and build momentum

The progress ring fills as time passes, the tab title updates with the countdown, and an alarm plays when each phase ends. After 4 sessions, the dot counter resets for your next cycle.

## 🎵 Sound Effects

All sounds are synthesized in real-time using the **Web Audio API** — no external audio files, no loading, no broken links. Choose from:

| Sound | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔔 Bell | Warm, layered sine wave chime |
| ✨ Chime | Ascending melodic notes |
| 🎵 Synth | Soft triangle + sawtooth pad |
| 📢 Ping | Sharp, attention-grabbing pulses |
| 🌊 Calm | Filtered noise wash with a gentle tone |

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Structure
- **CSS3** — Styling, animations, theme system via CSS variables
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Timer logic, Web Audio API for sounds
- **Google Fonts** — Space Mono + Outfit

Zero frameworks. Zero dependencies. Zero build steps.
